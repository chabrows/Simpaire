# Simpaire
This repository contains all the python files and the setup needed te reproduce the biomechanical simulations of a decrease hip extension during stance and a decrease knee flexion during swing

## Folder content
+ **SCONE_files**:  This repository contains SCONE files used to simulate a decrease knee flexion during the swing phase and a decrease hip extension during the stance phase (minimum hip angle = -15 deg, minimum hip angle = -13 deg, minimum hip angle = -9 deg, minimum hip angle = -9 deg, minimum hip angle = -7 deg, minimum hip angle = -5 deg, minimum hip angle = -3 deg, minimum hip angle = 0 deg).
